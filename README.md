# Abstract
CLI Flashcards is a node.js application that runs in the CLI (command line interface) and provides (by default) a set of 30 questions related to or regarding Javascript. Users can interact by using their keyboard and choosing a multiple choice selection using numbers and then submitting their answers with the enter key! Upon completion the user will be presented with their score and the application will end.

# Install/Setup instructions
To install clone the repo down or download using download button. Make sure you have node installed and navigate to the directory using the command `cd flashcards-starter` - after you are in the directory it should be as simple as running the command `node index.js`.

From there the game will start with the prepopulated questions as stored in the data.js file. Though this can easily be changed in src/game.js under the assigned currentDeck.

Navigate your way through the questions by using numbers 1-3 on the keyboard and pressing enter to submit your answer. When the flashcard deck has completed it will notify you and present you with the score.
